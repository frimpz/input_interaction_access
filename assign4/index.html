		<p>In may of every year the football season comes to a close, this is followed by a period popularly called the transfer window.  In this period football clubs can transfer players from other clubs into their squad. 
		There is a lot of mixed feelings among many football fans, some are excited about  incoming players, others are disappointed when their good players are transferred out of the club. it turns to hurt the most when bigger clubs influence star players to force a move out of the club. 
		Bigger clubs are mostly the beneficiaries, selling their unwanted players and buying better players.
		</p>


		<h2>Shocking Transfers</h2>

		<p>Contrary to this behavour, last year’s transfer window  was not the case. Fans of Real Madrid undoubtedly, one of the giants in the footballing world saw their best player Christiano Ronaldo leave the club. Reasons why the club let such a player go is still unclear. There are rumors that he had problems with Fiorentino perez the club’s president. Others say he was just tired of playing in the same club for over nine years, whereas others believe he had to leave so that younger players can have the opportunity to shine.
		As a madrid fan I wondered how the club leaders could sell a player like Ronaldo when players like Benzema were still around.
		In the previous transfer window Barcelona, arch rivals of Real Madrid also saw , Neymar who many tipped to fill in the boots of their star player Messi  leave the club.</p>

			<p id="caption_1" class="caption">Christiano Ronaldo in Real Madrid.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div><p>
			Personally I think those transfers were mistakes the two clubs made. For instance real madrid who had won the European competition for three consecutive years was knocked out of same competition by an average team like ajax in the round of 16 stage. Barcelona who also  dominated european football for sometime  also failed to qualify to the semi finals for three consecutive years.
		</p></div>


		<h2> Player Replacements<h3>How good are they?</h3></h2>

		<div role="img" aria-labelledby="caption_2">
			<img src="hazard.png" alt="Eden Hazard, the new signing" class="blog_img">
			<p id="caption_2" class="caption">Eden Hazard, Real Madrid's new player.</p>
		</div>	

		<div>
			<p>
			This year Real Madrid in an attempt to correct their mistake  just signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea. Barcelona, two years after selling Neymar has still not been able to find a very good replacement, although they have bought the likes of Coutinho and Dembele for very high prices.
			Well there is no doubt this season will be filled with excitment as Madrid now has Hazard and Barcelona has signed another player Antoine Griezmann. The question still remains will these players be able to fill the gaps left?
