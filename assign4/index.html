		<h2>In may of every year</h2>
		
		<p>In may of every year the football season comes to a close, this is followed by a ……………period popularly called the transfer window.  In this period football clubs can transfer players from other clubs into their squad. This period is characterized by several rumors started mostly by the media
		There is a lot of mixed feelings among many football fans, whereas some are excited about the incoming players others are disappointed when the god players are transferred out of the club, it turns to hurt the most when bigger clubs influence star players to force a move out of the club. Once the darling and most appreciated player, players who force moves become the most hated players of their previous clubs overnight, especially when the move is to a rival club. 
		Bigger clubs however rarely transfer out their players, these clubs are the gurus, the beneficiaries or the ones who benefit the most because they sell out their unwanted players and buy better players at will.

		<h3>The Shocking Transfer</h3>
		<div role="img" aria-labelledby="caption_1">
			<img src="ronaldo.jpg" alt="Christiano Ronaldo" class="blog_img">
			<p id="caption_1" class="caption">Figure 1: The caption.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div><p>Last year’s transfer window however was not the case, Real Madrid undoubtedly one of the giants in the footballing world saw their most influential or exceptional player, Christiano Ronaldo leave the club. Rumors have it that there was a problem between him and Fiorentino perez the club’s president. Others say he was just tired of playing in the same club for over nine years, whereas others believe his time in the footballing world is up because of his age and he had to make way for other young players to have their shine, others also believe he was demanding so much in increment of wages which was going to distabilze the wage structure of the club.
		The question is if any of these rumors are true, was it worth it transferring him out. Club dependent players  normally retire in the clubs or are transferred out when they have very little to offer, but this is not the case with Ronaldo, he is exceptional, a phenomenon and one of those players who spring up once in a century. A Manchester united(Ronaldo previous club) fan said right to my face “what is wrong with your club, Ronaldo is not the type of player you let go for any amount of money,  don’t you guys learn, see what is happing to my club after he left“.

		<h3>Can he fill in?</h3>

		<div role="img" aria-labelledby="caption_2">
			<img src="hazard.png" alt="Eden Hazard, the new signing" class="blog_img">
			<p id="caption_2" class="caption">Figure 1: The caption.</p>
		</div>	

		<div>
			<p>
			This year Real Madrid is trying to coverup for their mistakes, by signing a very good player Eden Hazard from Chelsea, the question is, can Hazard fill the gap Ronaldo left, this is a player who scored over 50 goals for seven seasons consecutively, even football legends like pele and Maradona did not do such. 

			The question of why let a player who scores over 70% of your goals go is still hanging and until a replacement is found, fans of real Madrid may never leave the neck of Fiorentino perez who for all that he has done is a great president.
